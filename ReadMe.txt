Project Part 4

File Saving Method:
I am using serialization to save and load files. Survey files are saved with a .surv extension. Test files are saved with a .tes extension.

File Location:
Both sample Survey/Test files (finalSurv.surv and finalTest.tes) are stored in the "files" folder in the Project folder. This is the folder that all surveys and tests are saved to once created with the program.

All sample responses for both these files are saved in the "responses" folder in the Project folder. The "responses" folder is where all user responses are saved after a survey or test is taken.


Issues:
Crash problems from last submission have been resolved. No new issues that I am aware of.
